## Components

### cpu-powersave

Trivial boot service to move the system into powersave/on-demand CPU governor. The Solus kernel is configured to prefer `performance` by default, and lazily changing this later in the boot helps to maintain decent boot times as well as being conservative with battery life.

### modprobe

Various `modprobe.d` snippets to fix and blacklist certain hardware.

### tweaks

`sysctl` tweaks. Previously contained HDD tweaks but has since been removed.

### xorg

Legacy X11 snippets for problematic hardware. Should be unnecessary when using `libinput`.
